# project_1

For this assignment, our group decided to do an analysis on Formula 1 racing. We wanted to find out the impact that different aspects of the race have on the result of the race. We pulled our data from the following API:

https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/api-formula-1 

From this API, we pulled data such as the starting position, finishing position, pitstop times, driver name, and driver id. We each analyzed different races, and compared our findings and noticed where we had similarities, and differences. We made scatter plots comparing starting position to finishing position, positions gained/lost to starting position, and positions gained/lost to pitstop times.

Whenever we pulled from the api, the api gave us proscribed code to copy and paste to pull the necessary data. We also utilized support from our professor for some help with sorting the data into dataframes.
